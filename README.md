# JSville Courier Management System ðŸšš

## Overview
The JSville Courier Management System is a lightweight, browser-based application for managing package deliveries. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it provides a simple yet effective solution for tracking and sorting packages.

## Features
- âœ… Package data entry with validation
- ðŸ“¦ Real-time package tracking
- ðŸ”„ Efficient sorting using Merge Sort algorithm
- ðŸŽ¯ Unique tracking code generation
- ðŸ’» Clean, responsive user interface

## Technical Details

### Validation Rules
- Package ID: Numeric values only
- Recipient Name: Alphabetic characters and spaces
- Delivery Address: Letters, spaces, and basic punctuation
- Weight: Positive numeric values (in kilograms)

### Sorting Algorithm
The system uses Merge Sort (O(n log n)) for efficient package sorting based on weight. This ensures optimal performance even with large datasets.

### Tracking Code Generation
Unique tracking codes are generated using bitwise operations combining package ID and weight:
```javascript
(packageId << 8 | weightInt).toString(2)
```
